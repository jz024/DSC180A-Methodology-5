**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I think the most interesting topic that we learned and practiced in the llm domain is different techniques of prompting. We focused on direct prompting, chain of thought promptnig, and few shot prompting, and compared their performances across different datasets and different versions of llm models. It's interesting to see how a prompting technique is particularly useful for a specific kind of dataset. This is also very helpful for us to implement it in our quarter 2 project, to make our llm prompt more targeted and precise for the application. Even if our current idea for quarter 2 project doesn't work, this will still be helpful as long as we are doing llm related applications.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation that I would like to pursue is the backend and data management of the llm application. I've only worked with implementing the llm itself (like developing a chatbot), but not storing the data or any other backend engineering. I want to learn about how to store and retrieve data effectively with a large scale llm model/application, which is crutial for our quarter 2 project since we need to take llm response time into account.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I can't really think of a different change that I'd taken in quarter 1 project, since everything is very standard and clear. The only thing that I would change if I start all over again is to start the quarter 1 project early, so that I will have more time to brainstorm the details of the quarter 2 project and learn anything necessary to carry out the application. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would also be interested in learning more about UI/UX design and writing a website. These are really important aspects of an application, since if people don't really understand how to use it and what's the point of the application, no matter how good your llm is, people will not use it. So I think having a background knowledge about design and frontend will help a lot in the process of developing the application.
